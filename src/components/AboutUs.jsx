        <h4><strong>Third-Eye</strong> is a dynamic attendance collector which can be used used in any authority for tracking the performance of a candidate. It is very suitable for offices, colleges, school etc, where tracking the performance of a student or employee is not at all an easy task. After giving one full day attendance one can easily move around as nobody checks the CCTV regularly. In this system, we will ensure the presence of any person in a particular room/place where he/she should be when in the duty. If anyone makes any problem then it will report to the respective higher authority about this. Thus we can ensure anybody is giving his/her duty in the service time properly or not.</h4>
